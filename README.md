Task has been completed using different libraries to showcase my familiarity with all the NLP libraries.
Directed graph has been created using two methods i.e networkx and neo4j
question_6.py = File that was uploaded before the deadline
question_6_revised.py = Uploaded today as I faced issues with indexing no question_6.py yesterday and I couldn't ask full questions or get a fully reply on the same.
It was only able to ansnwer if I gave only a subject else it wouldn't answer. However that issue has been resolved in question_6_revised.py
