Task has been completed using different libraries to showcase my familiarity with the various NLP libraries.
Directed graph has been created using methods such as networkx and neo4j to show my familiarity with these methods.
question_6.py is the file that was uploaded before the deadline and 
question_6_revised.py is the file that has been uploaded today. The reason behind this was that I was not able to get a fully functioning reply on the former solution. If i mentioned a specific subject , It would give the reply but I wan't able to ask a full question. I thought the issue was with indexing and I browsed almost every conceivable source trying to find the solution. The same has been resolved now.
